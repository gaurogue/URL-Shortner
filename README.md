# URL-Shortner
🚀 URL Shortener in Go (Golang)

A simple and efficient URL Shortener built using Golang, featuring hashing, JSON APIs, and HTTP redirection. This project demonstrates backend fundamentals such as routing, encoding/decoding JSON, and handling HTTP requests.

✨ Features

🔗 Shorten any long URL into an 8-character hash-based short URL

⚡ Fast in-memory storage using Go maps

🔄 Redirection support

📡 JSON API for creating short URLs

🧩 Easy to extend with database support (Redis, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)

🛠 How It Works
1️⃣ Create a short URL

Send a POST request to /shorten with JSON:

{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}


You will receive:

{
  "short_url": "a1b2c3d4"
}

2️⃣ Redirect to the original URL

Open in browser:

http://localhost:3000/redirect/a1b2c3d4


You are redirected to the original website.

🧠 Behind the Scenes

The short URL is generated by taking an MD5 hash of the original URL and using the first 8 characters.

All URLs are stored in an in-memory map[string]URL.

The project uses Go’s built-in:

net/http for server and routing

crypto/md5 for hashing

encoding/json for JSON parsing
